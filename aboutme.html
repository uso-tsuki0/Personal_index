            As a MSI student major in data sience and analytics with several experiences
            of projects and researches, I am positive about my ability to contribute

            cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization and machine learning with
             multiple datasets in various projects. Meanwhile, I have worked as a teaching 
             assistant for three courses, collecting and analyzing data from different forms with Python and Excel to evaluate course outcomes and report it to the instructor, which equips me of the ability of communicating findings to the target audience.
